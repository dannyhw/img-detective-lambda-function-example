# img-detective-lambda-function-example

Testing out hash generation for duplicate image detection using lambda functions.

This is an example lambda function based on the imagehash library. The
repository is quite large due to the fact that external libraries need to be
provided explicitly.

The file lambda_index_one.py contains the code for indexing a single image.
The hash generating code is in the imagedetective folder.

to test the function try running `python lambda_index_one.py`
